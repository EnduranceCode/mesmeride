# About Mesmeride

Mesmeride is a web app that was created by [Marc Durdin](https://github.com/mcdurdin) that "allows you to take any Strava activity or segment, and graph it out in a number of different styles. You can add waypoints and control the length, height and size of the presentation, making it suitable for print or web. After tweaking the style of the graph to perfection, you can share the result on Twitter or Facebook, embed the image on your blog, or save it for printing or offline sharing".

As Marc Durdin has explained in is [blog post](https://marc.durdin.net/2015/05/doing-a-google-aka-closing-downhanding-over-some-stuff/), the original site ([mesmeride.com](http://www.mesmeride.com/)) has been shutdown and the app isn't under development anymore.

I've forked the original [repository](https://github.com/mcdurdin/mesmeride) because I would like to (someday) be able to port it to [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) and put it online again in a [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) website. Hopefully I will have the time and the knowledge to do it.

I would like to thank @mcdurdin for his generosity.
